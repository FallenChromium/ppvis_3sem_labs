# ППвИС* Labs (third semester)
This repo contains solutions to some of the assignments that I had in my university. In every folder there's a brief description of the contents and a link to a detailed task description. Some of the folders may contain brief explanations on how to compile\run the program.

I created this repository for several reasons:
1. For historical purposes
2. To create a reference for future "generations" (basically for those who will study in the same place I am studying now)
3. In case anyone will be interested in my skills level, this repo is one of the ways to evaluate them. 
Do note though that those are assignments, the main goal of completing such tasks is to learn, not to write production-ready, "perfect" code, 
so I didn't spend much time optimizing the algorithms or making the code pretty.


*ППвИС = ppvis = Проектирование программ в интеллектуальных системах = Software Design in intelligent systems.
